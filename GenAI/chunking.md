# Chunking in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Chunking is the process of splitting large text documents into smaller, manageable pieces called "chunks." In RAG models, chunking helps improve retrieval efficiency and relevance by allowing the model to search and process smaller text segments.

## Why Chunking?

- **Efficient Retrieval:** Searching smaller chunks is faster and more accurate than searching entire documents.
- **Context Management:** Chunks help keep context windows within model limits.
- **Improved Relevance:** The model can retrieve only the most relevant chunks for a given query.

## How Chunking Works

1. **Split the Text:** The input text is divided into chunks, often by sentences, paragraphs, or fixed token sizes.
2. **Vectorize Each Chunk:** Each chunk is converted into a vector representation (embedding).
3. **Store and Retrieve:** Chunks and their vectors are stored in a database or vector store. During retrieval, the most relevant chunks are selected based on similarity to the query.

## Example

Suppose we have the following text:

> "RAG models combine retrieval and generation. They use external knowledge sources. Chunking helps organize the data for efficient search."

**Step 1: Chunking**

- Chunk 1: "RAG models combine retrieval and generation. They use external knowledge sources."
- Chunk 2: "Chunking helps organize the data for efficient search."

**Step 2: Vectorization**

Each chunk is converted into a vector (e.g., using word counts or embeddings).

**Step 3: Retrieval**

When a user asks a question, the model retrieves the most relevant chunk(s) and uses them to generate an answer.

Chunking is a key step in making RAG models scalable and effective for large document collections.
