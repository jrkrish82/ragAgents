Albert Einstein was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany. From a young age, he showed a deep curiosity for the mysteries of nature and an exceptional ability in mathematics and physics. His early education laid the foundation for his future groundbreaking work in science.

Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. His famous equation, E=mc^2, demonstrated the relationship between energy and mass, and had profound implications for both theoretical physics and practical applications.

Beyond his scientific achievements, Einstein was also a passionate advocate for peace and civil rights. He spoke out against war and discrimination, and his humanitarian efforts earned him respect worldwide. Einstein's legacy continues to inspire scientists and thinkers across the globe.
