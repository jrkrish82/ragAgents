# Intelli Cash Forecasting Agent

## Use Case
The Intelli Cash Forecasting Agent is designed to enhance cash flow management by providing accurate predictions of future cash inflows and outflows. In financial institutions or banks, cash forecasting can be challenging due to the inherent uncertainty of predicting the future. Factors such as economic conditions, customer behavior, and operational issues can impact cash flow. Inaccurate cash forecasts may lead to poor decision-making and financial problems.

## Solution & Benefits
This function is useful for visualizing cash flow trends across multiple branches over time. By plotting the Closing Balance for each branch, stakeholders can compare financial performance and identify patterns or anomalies in cash flow. Examples include:
- Branches with consistently declining balances may require intervention.
- Seasonal trends or spikes in cash flow can be identified for specific branches.

The main goal is to improve decision-making and ensure financial stability by leveraging historical data to make real-time predictions.

## Innovativeness
- Combine ARIMA with machine learning models like LSTM or XGBoost to capture both linear and nonlinear patterns in cash flow data.
- Design the agent to auto-correct its predictions based on real-time deviations, using feedback loops and anomaly detection.
- Use blockchain to secure and verify financial transactions feeding into the forecasting model, ensuring data integrity.

## User Experience
- Users receive clear, data-driven forecasts that reduce guesswork.
- The agent provides instant updates as new data flows in, keeping users informed without manual refreshes or recalculations.
- Visualizations such as cash flow curves, heatmaps, and forecast bands make complex data easy to interpret.

## Business Opportunity
- Target large enterprises with complex cash flows (e.g., manufacturing, retail, IT services).
- Provide a solution that reduces working capital inefficiencies, improves liquidity planning, and enhances CFO decision-making.
- Partner with banks or fintechs to embed the agent into their platforms, helping banks offer predictive cash management tools to SMEs and corporates.

## Ease of Implementation
- **Availability of Historical Data**: Most organizations already have structured financial data (e.g., cash inflows/outflows, receivables, payables).
- **ARIMA Compatibility**: Works well with time series data, which is common in finance.
- **Development Tools**: Libraries like Python’s `statsmodels`, R’s `forecast`, or platforms like Azure ML and AWS SageMaker simplify model development.

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Basic ARIMA-based forecasting.
2. **Phase 2**: Add anomaly detection and feedback loops.
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate with dashboards.

## Scalable & Reusable
- **Data Volume Handling**: ARIMA can scale to handle large datasets using frameworks like Spark.
- **Streaming Data Pipelines**: With tools like Kafka or Azure Event Hubs, the agent can scale to provide near real-time forecasts.
- **Modular Architecture**: Using Model Context Protocol (MCP), the forecasting agent can interact with other agents (e.g., anomaly detection, financial planning, risk analysis). Each agent specializes in a task but shares context.

### Example Use Case in MCP Framework
- **Cash Forecasting Agent**: Predicts future cash positions and receives context from ERP and financial planning agents.
- **Anomaly Detection Agent**: Flags unusual transactions and shares alerts with the forecasting agent to adjust predictions.
- **Strategy Agent**: Suggests financial actions using forecast output to recommend investments or cost controls.

## Financial Feasibility
### Implementation Timeline
1. **Discovery & Data Prep**: 2–3 weeks (Identify data sources, clean data).
2. **Model Development**: 2–4 weeks (Build and test ARIMA model).
3. **UI/UX Design**: 2 weeks (Create agent interface).
4. **Integration & Testing**: 2–3 weeks (Connect to tools, test workflows using MCP).
5. **Deployment & Training**: 1–2 weeks (Go live and onboard users).

## ▶️ Running the App

### Prerequisites
Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Install Dependencies
Before running the app, install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install streamlit matplotlib pandas statsmodels
```

If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install all dependencies at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch the App
Use the following command to launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run cash_flow_forecasting_ui.py
```

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter the error `'streamlit' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file`, follow these steps:
1. Verify that Streamlit is installed by running:
   ```bash
   pip show streamlit
   ```
   If it is not installed, run `pip install streamlit` again.

2. Ensure that the Python `Scripts` directory is added to your system's PATH environment variable. For example:
   - On Windows, add `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<version>\Scripts` to PATH.
   - Restart your terminal or command prompt after updating PATH.

3. Use `python -m streamlit run cash_flow_forecasting_ui.py` as an alternative command if the issue persists.
